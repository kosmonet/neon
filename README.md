# The Neon Roguelike Engine
## Notification
The engine is no longer under development in Java. A switch was made to .Net under the new name Argon.

## Requirements
The engine is written for Java 8, and uses JavaFX 8 for the user interface. 

The following external libraries are needed to build the engine:
* JDOM 2.0.6 or later
* Guava 27.0.1 or later (and dependencies)
* Gson 2.8.5 or later
* DejaVu Sans Mono font

## Installation
You will need a Java 8 runtime. The engine has been tested under Windows, with the [Oracle JRE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), version 8. Versions later than 10 are not guaranteed to work, as JavaFX has been moved to a separate release for version 11. The Nashorn scripting engine has been deprecated in version 11, and may not be present in future versions. For Linux users, most distributions offer [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) and OpenJFX packages.
