<h1>Creatures</h1>
<h2>Add/remove creatures</h2>
Right click to add or remove creatures. When adding a creature, an id for the
creature is requested. If a creature with the given id already exists, the 
creature will not be 
created. When a new creature is added, the creature editor window will open.

<h2>Edit creatures</h2>
Double click on a creature to open the creature editor window.

<h3>Name</h3>
By default, the name of the creature is the same as the id. If the name field
is left empty, the creature id will also be used.
