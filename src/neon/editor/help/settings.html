<h1>Module settings</h1>
<h2>Game title</h2>
Every game has a title that is shown on the main menu screen and in the window
title bar. If no title is defined, the engine will just use <q>neon</q> as 
title. If multiple loaded modules all define a title, the title from the last 
module in the load order is used. If you do not wish to redefine the title, 
leave this field blank.

<h2>Start map and position</h2>
These fields define the map where the game will start and the location on that
map where the player will be positioned at the start. Again, if multiple 
modules all define a start map, the one from the last module in the load order
will be used. If you do not wish to redefine the start map or position, leave
the map field empty and the coordinate fields at -1.

<h2>Parent modules</h2>
A module may depend on other modules. These parent modules must be defined, so
the engine can perform a check at startup. Right click on the list to add or 
remove parents. The engine nor the editor check for
circular dependencies, this is the responsibility of the module author.

<h2>Playable species</h2>
This is a list of all the species available for the player character. Right 
click on the list to add or remove species. The 
species in this list will be added to the ones defined by parent modules. It
is not possible to remove species already defined by a parent module.
