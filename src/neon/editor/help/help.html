<h1>Getting started</h1>

<h2>Create a new module</h2>
<p>Click on <i>File > New...</i> to create a new module. This will open a 
dialog box requesting an id for the new module. This id should be unique. If 
the id already exists, the module will not be created.</p>

<p>The new module will be created without any content. The default name of 
a module is the same as the module id.</p>

<h2>Open an existing module</h2>
<p>Click on <i>File > Open...</i> to open a module. Select the folder that 
contains the module and click on the <i>Select Folder</i> button.</p>

<p>The module folder should be placed in the neon <i>data</i> folder before 
opening. If the folder is located in another location, or does not actually 
contain a module, the editor will behave in exciting and unexpected ways.</p>

<h2>Save a module</h2>
<p>After loading or creating a module, the <i>Save</i> menu item will become
available in the <i>File</i> menu.</p> 

<p>The editor keeps a backup in the neon <i>temp</i> folder. In case of 
emergency, unsaved data can be manually recovered from here. Do not start the editor or 
a game, however, as that will overwrite this folder.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
All editable data in a module is represented by a <em>resource</em>. They are 
shown in different colors and styles:

<ul>
	<li>default: a resource from the currently active module that was not present
	in any parent module.</li>
	<li><font color="gray">gray</font>: a resource from a parent module that was
	<b>not</b> redefined in the currently active module.</li>	
	<li><font color="darkred">dark red</font>: a resource from a parent module 
	that was redefined in the currently active module.</li>	
	<li><i>italic</i>: a resource that was edited, but not yet saved.</li>
</ul>
