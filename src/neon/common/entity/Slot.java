 * <p>Slots that accept armor have a modifier to indicate how much that slot 
 * contributes to overall protection. As an example, the head slot has a 
 * modifier of 0.1. If a helmet with armor rating 200 is equipped, this will
 * increase the total armor rating of a creature by 0.1Ã—200 = 20.</p>
